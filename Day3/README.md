# Creating a Blockchain network and app with Hyperledger Fabric

We will go through the following exercises to understand building your Fabric network and developing an application with Hyperledger Fabric SDK.

## Prerequisite

Ensure you have all the prerequisites installed for operating Hyperledger Fabric:
http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/prereqs.html


## 1. Build your first network

We will following the instruction presented [HERE](./BYFN.md):

* Install Samples, Binaries and Docker Images
* Generate Network artifacts
* Create a Channel Configuration Transaction
* Start the network
* Create & join Channel
* Update the anchor peers
* Install & Instantiate Chaincode
* Interact with network

## 2. Writing your First App

We will be following the instructions presented [HERE](./FirstApp.md): 

* Install Samples, Binaries and Docker Images
* Setting up your Dev Environment
* Install the clients & launch the network
* Enrolling the Admin User
* Register and Enroll `user1`
* Querying the Ledger
* Updating the Ledger


## 3. Explore IBM Code pattern
We will explore the marbles application to gain a greater understanding of creating an application with Hyperledger Fabric, using Fabric Node SDK and Golang chaincode.

* https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/marbles
* Review architecture
* Review chaincode
* Review sdk to enroll users
* Review sdk to interact with network
